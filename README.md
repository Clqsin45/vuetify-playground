# [Vuetify Playground](https://joouis.com/vuetify-playground/)

## Introduction

Developers new to Vuetify must want to go through all its UI components quickly. For me, it's also very important to know the mobile experience powered by it. After checking official website and popular resources from `awesome-vuetify`, there is no common playground (like React Native Playground) about this. So I build this playground from the official examples on Vuetify website with 2 advantages:

- For the developers who's surveying this framework, it's more convenient to see and try all UI components at once, without loading every component's page or watching too much descriptions.
- It's designed for mobile at first, so both mobile and PC users can take advantage of it.
